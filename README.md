# POSIX message queues for OCaml

The ocaml-mqueue library provides [POSIX message queue](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/mqueue.h.html) bindings for OCaml.

This library has been tested on Linux, but QNX, Solaris etc. should work, too.
Mac OS X on the other hand does currently NOT provide POSIX message queues (as of OS X 10.10).
